## Resources

+ [CashFusion - Trust](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md)
+ In this session we discuss how CashFusion is attempting to ensure that no party in an unequal amount mix learns the mapping.
+ In this session we will not dive into the combinatorics, instead we leave that for part 2.
+ In this session we will also touch some topics on CoinShuffle++ too.
